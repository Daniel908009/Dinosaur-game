The first dinosaur fossil was discovered in 1824 by Reverend William Buckland, who named it Megalosaurus.
The term "dinosaur" means "terrible lizard" and was coined by Sir Richard Owen in 1842.
Dinosaurs lived during the Mesozoic Era, which is divided into the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods.
Nyasasaurus from Tanzania, estimated to be around 243 million years old, may be the oldest known dinosaur.
The largest known dinosaur is Argentinosaurus, a titanosaur that could reach up to 100 feet in length and weigh up to 100 tons.
Microraptor was about the size of a pigeon, with some species measuring only a few inches long.
Archaeopteryx, discovered in 1861, was one of the first dinosaurs found with evidence of feathers.
Modern birds are considered avian dinosaurs, descended from theropods.
T. rex had one of the strongest bite forces of any land animal, estimated at over 12,800 pounds of force.
Many dinosaurs were herbivores, like Brachiosaurus and Triceratops.
Carnivorous dinosaurs, like Velociraptor and Allosaurus, were often agile hunters.
Some dinosaurs, like Oviraptor, may have had a varied diet including both plants and small animals.
Dinosaurs laid eggs, and some species, like Maiasaura, showed evidence of parental care.
Dinosaurs ranged in size from small bird-like creatures to massive titans like Diplodocus.
Fossil evidence suggests some dinosaurs had colorful feathers, possibly for display or camouflage.
Dinosaurs like Triceratops and Pachycephalosaurus had unique head ornaments, possibly for display, defense, or thermoregulation.
Ankylosaurus and Stegosaurus had bony armor and tail spikes for protection.
Some dinosaurs, like Velociraptor, were likely fast runners, while others, like Stegosaurus, were slower.
Theropods, such as Deinonychus, had sharp claws used for hunting.
Dinosaurs are classified into two main groups based on hip structure: Saurischia (lizard-hipped) and Ornithischia (bird-hipped).
Dinosaurs went extinct around 66 million years ago, likely due to a combination of factors including an asteroid impact.
Dinosaur fossils are found on every continent, including Antarctica.
Spinosaurus is considered the largest carnivorous dinosaur, potentially reaching lengths of up to 59 feet.
Mamenchisaurus had one of the longest necks of any dinosaur, with some estimates suggesting it could reach up to 50 feet in length.
Some dinosaurs, like Stegosaurus, had relatively small brains for their body size.
Some dinosaurs may have incubated their eggs similar to birds, using body heat or nesting materials.
Pterosaurs were flying reptiles, not dinosaurs, though they lived during the same time period.
Some dinosaurs, like Spinosaurus, showed adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle.
Sauropods, like Brachiosaurus, had nostrils on the top of their heads.
Trace fossils, like footprints, provide evidence of dinosaur behavior and movement.
Some dinosaurs may have had excellent vision, possibly even in color, to spot predators or prey.
Many theropods, including Velociraptor, had feathers, and some may have used them for display or thermoregulation.
It's uncertain what sounds dinosaurs made, but some may have communicated through vocalizations or other means.
Fossilized skin impressions show that some dinosaurs had scaly skin, while others had feathers.
Evidence suggests that some dinosaurs, like Edmontosaurus, may have lived in herds.
CT scans of dinosaur braincases reveal details about their sensory abilities and intelligence.
The end-Cretaceous extinction that wiped out dinosaurs was one of several mass extinction events in Earth's history.
Dinosaur bones fossilize through a process called permineralization, where minerals replace organic material.
Rare finds of preserved soft tissue provide insights into dinosaur physiology.
Some dinosaur species built nests and showed signs of caring for their young.
Some evidence suggests that certain dinosaurs may have migrated seasonally.
Ankylosaurus had a bony club at the end of its tail, likely used for defense.
Fossil evidence suggests that some dinosaurs had four-chambered hearts, similar to birds and mammals.
Theropods like Troodon had relatively large brains and may have been among the more intelligent dinosaurs.
The teeth of herbivorous dinosaurs were adapted for grinding plants, while carnivorous dinosaurs had sharp teeth for tearing meat.
Some dinosaurs, like Tyrannosaurus rex, experienced rapid growth spurts during their teenage years.
Recent studies suggest that some dinosaurs had a variety of skin colors, potentially for camouflage or display.
Despite their large size, many dinosaurs had small brains relative to their body mass.
The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 230 million years ago.
Despite popular culture, cloning dinosaurs from DNA, is currently not possible due to the degradation of genetic material over millions of years.
